		<h3>Booklist</h3>
		
		<p>
			“The world is stable now,” states the Controller in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, asserting how peaceful and perfect society is under his control. When I first read this line, it struck a deep chord in me; since childhood, I’ve been obsessed with the concept of Utopia. Born in a country that has controversial politics, I’ve seen thousands of online voices debating questions such as “How can we construct a better society?” and “What is a perfect, or just, society like?” Though these inquiries frequently arise, I’ve heard no convincing answers. In my history textbook, I saw how Laozi says that a small state with a small population can satisfy every citizen’s needs; yet, on the next page, Plato fiercely argues that only the most knowledgeable and righteous philosophers called “philosophy kings” can guide the polis toward perfection. Thousands of people have thousands of ideas, but after reading Brave New World — which quickly became my favorite novel — I’ve decided to vigorously search for my own perfect society.
